# mnist-explanation

In this repository, I try to implement explanation methods as described by G. Montavon et al. in their paper `Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks` [1]

## Neural Network Implementation

In their original paper, the researchers do not explicit the structure of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) used in the scope of their study.
